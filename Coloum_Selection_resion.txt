For predicting hair loss, the following columns would likely be most useful:

Genetics – Genetic predisposition plays a significant role in hair loss.
Hormonal Changes – Hormonal fluctuations (e.g., thyroid imbalance, menopause) contribute to hair loss.
Medical Conditions – Conditions like thyroid disease, alopecia, or autoimmune disorders affect hair health.
Medications & Treatments – Certain medications or treatments (like chemotherapy) can cause hair loss.
Nutritional Deficiencies – Deficiencies in vitamins and minerals (like iron, biotin) can lead to hair thinning.
Stress – Physical or emotional stress is a known factor in hair shedding.
Age – As people age, hair growth slows, and thinning or loss increases.
Weight Loss – Rapid or significant weight loss can lead to hair shedding.
Less directly impactful but could still provide some insights:

Poor Hair Care Habits – While bad habits (like excessive heat or tight hairstyles) contribute to breakage, they might not predict hair loss on their own.
Environmental Factors – Environmental exposure (pollution, climate) can affect hair health but might not be a strong predictor of hair loss in isolation.
Smokig – Smoking can negatively impact hair growth by affecting circulation, but it’s generally a secondary factor.
Hair Lossn would be the target column (the one you're trying to predict). The rest are input features that can help build the model.
